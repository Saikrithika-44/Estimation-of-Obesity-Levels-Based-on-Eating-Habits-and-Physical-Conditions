**Estimation-of-Obesity-Levels-Based-on-Eating-Habits-and-Physical-Conditions

This project focuses on classifying obesity levels using machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with 2,111 records and 17 attributes collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, the aim was to predict obesity categories based on lifestyle and health metrics. After preprocessing (encoding, duplicate removal, and scaling) and feature selection through correlation analysis, the models were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression achieved 86% accuracy, Gaussian Naïve Bayes reached 61%, and SVM performed best with 89% accuracy—further improving to 97% after hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. The results indicate that optimized SVM is the most effective model for this multi-class classification task, offering strong potential for real-world application in healthcare analytics for early detection and prevention of obesity-related conditions
